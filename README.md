# Library

This is a simple "online library" where you can log book you had read or which one are you going to read! It's not optimized for mobile devices (but i think i did a decent job with the unit of measurement, it's usable on mobiles) and no frameworks were used. The graphic can be improved but for now it's ok.

TODO:
- Rewrite all the code, it's too much messed up
- Add the possibility to insert the year of publication and  the publisher
