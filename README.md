# Library
This is a simple "online library" where you can log book you had read or which one are you going to read! It's not optimized for mobile devices (but i think i did a decent job with the unit of measurement, with some difficults it's usable on mobiles) and no frameworks were used. The graphic can be improved but for now it's ok.
